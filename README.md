# SNoW
Social Networking Web protocol. An open, extensible, distributed, secure, censorship and surveiliance resistant protocol for social networking.


## Rationale
In an age of increasing dragnet surveiliance and privacy invasion, combined with the ever increasing popularity, we are faced with a problem; how do we build a system for social networking which allows for privacy, while allowing interoperability and the ability to easily change service providers should a social network breach trust. SNoW is a proposed answer to this problem. SNoW is a protocol in a similar vein to XMPP and Tox, with the intent to allow users to easily shift between social networks as well as communicate across social networks. This gives users freedom of choice in which social network they use, while allowing them to maintain their network across services.

The end goal of SNoW is to create a protocol to allow for interoperability between social networks and to allow for social media to be made more secure and harder to censor or control. While the end goal will be difficult, it will also be worthwhile.
